<br>
### THEORY:<br>
The Common source (CS) Amplifier is one of the most widely used configurations in anaglog electronics, known for its high voltage gain and effectivenesss in signal amplications.<br>
It's functionality is assessed through three major evaluations:<br>
### ~ DC Analysis:
Focuses on establishing the biasing condition for determining the Q point to ensure that the MOSFET is in active region.
