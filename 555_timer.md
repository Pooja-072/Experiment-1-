# 1. MONOSTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR<br>
A monostable multivibrator is a type of electronic circuit that has one stable state and one temporary (unstable) state. When triggered by an external pulse, it temporarily switches to the unstable state for a specific period of time and then automatically returns to its stable state.<br>
* Also called a one-shot multivibrator.<br>
* Used to generate precise time delays or single output pulses.<br>
* Commonly implemented using logic gates, transistors, or timers like the 555 timer.<br>
In a 555 timer monostable mode, pressing a button (trigger) produces a high output pulse for a set time (determined by resistor and capacitor values), then the output goes low again.<br>

### Working Principle of Monostable Multivibrator:
A monostable multivibrator works by staying in a stable state under normal conditions. When an external trigger pulse is applied, the circuit temporarily shifts to an unstable state (for a pre-defined time) and then returns automatically to the stable state.<br>
<br>
#### Steps in the Working: <br>

1.Initial State (Stable): <br>

   * Output is in a default logic level (usually LOW or 0V).<br>
   * No changes occur until a trigger is received.<br>
<br>
2.Triggering:<br>

   * An external negative (or positive) trigger pulse is applied.<br>
   * The circuit detects this pulse and immediately switches to the unstable state.<br>
   * Output becomes HIGH for a specific time.<br>
<br>
3.Timing Interval (Unstable State):<br>

   * A timing capacitor starts charging or discharging through a resistor.<br>
   * The time period {ùëá},<br>
   T is determined by the RC time constant.<br>
#### ùëá = 1.1√óùëÖ√óùê∂ (for¬†555¬†timer-based¬†monostable)<br>

4.Return to Stable State:<br>

* After the time period, the capacitor reaches a certain voltage.<br>
* The circuit automatically resets itself and returns to its original stable state (LOW).<br>

### Key Components Involved:<br>
* Trigger Input: Starts the timing process.<br>
* RC Network (Resistor + Capacitor): Sets the pulse width (duration).<br>
*Comparator/Transistor/Timer IC: Detects voltage across the capacitor and controls switching.<br>

### DESIGN QUESTION:<br>

#### To use the 555 timer IC to design and build a monostable multivibrator such that, when activated, produces an output pulse with a width of 0.5 milliseconds.<br>

Calculation:<br>
Given:<br>
Pulse width T = 0.5 ms = 0.0005 s<br>
Capacitance C = 1 ¬µF = 1√ó10‚Åª‚Å∂ F<br>
Using the formula:<br>
T = (1.1 * R * C)<br>
R = (T/(1.1 * C)) = (0.0005/(1.1* 1 *10^(-6))) = 454.54 Œ©<br>

### 555 Timer Monostable Configuration ‚Äì Shortform:<br>
Pin 1 ‚Üí GND<br>
Pin 2 ‚Üí Trigger (LOW to activate)<br>

### Simulation Result:<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52b83cba-ef5e-45b0-bc13-a8cdd3982ab5)

In the above circuit, when the trigger voltage drops below 1/3 of Vcc, the output switches to HIGH.<br>

### Result <br>
The 555 timer in monostable mode successfully generates a single output pulse when the trigger voltage drops below 1/3 Vcc.<br>

### Inference<br>

* When the trigger voltage < 1/3 Vcc, the 555 timer recognizes it as a valid trigger.
* This causes the output (pin 3) to go HIGH for a specific time period.
* The capacitor charges during this time, determining the pulse width.
* After the time elapses, the output returns to LOW, completing the monostable operation.

# ASTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR <BR>
An astable multivibrator is an electronic circuit that continuously switches between two unstable states without any external trigger, generating a free-running square wave (oscillating output).<br>
* No stable state (unlike monostable).<br>
* Continuously produces ON-OFF (HIGH-LOW) pulses.<br>
* Acts as a clock, flasher, or tone generator.<br>
* Commonly built using 555 timer IC, transistors, or logic gates.<br>
In a 555 timer astable mode, the output at pin 3 continuously toggles between HIGH and LOW, creating a square wave whose frequency and duty cycle are set by two resistors (R1, R2) and a capacitor (C).<br>

### Working Principle of Astable Multivibrator (Using 555 Timer):<br>
An astable multivibrator has no stable state. It keeps toggling between HIGH and LOW automatically, creating a continuous square wave without any external trigger.<br>
<br>
#### Step-by-Step Working:<br>
1.Initial Condition:<br>

* When powered on, the capacitor (C) starts charging through R1 and R2.<br>
* As it charges, the voltage across the capacitor increases.<br>

2.Threshold Detection (2/3 Vcc):<br>

* When capacitor voltage reaches 2/3 Vcc, the internal comparator in the 555 timer resets the flip-flop, and the output goes LOW.<br>
* At this point, the discharge pin (7) is connected to GND.<br>

3.Discharging Phase:<br>
  
* The capacitor now discharges through R2 and pin 7.<br>
* When voltage drops below 1/3 Vcc, the flip-flop is set again and the output goes HIGH.<br>

4.Recharging:<br>

* The capacitor starts charging again through R1 and R2.<br>
* This cycle repeats continuously, generating a square wave output.<br>

formulas<br>
ton = 0.69*(R1+R2)*C<br>
toff = 0.69*R2*C<br>
from calculations , <br>
R2 = 29.98kohm<br>
R1= 14.5kohm<br>
c= 0.01uF<br>

#### CASE 2:<br>
Given<br>
ton = 0.2ms & toff = 0.05ms<br>
assume ,<br>
R1 = 72kohm<br> & R2 = 72kohm<br>
by formula <br>
C = 1nF<br>

#### CASE 3:<br>
Given<br>
ton = 0.1ms & toff = 0.4ms<br>
Check if possible:<br>
* Since in a 555 timer astable, ùë°on > ùë°off always.<br>
Here ton < toff, not possible<br>
so swap values<br>
new ton= 0.4ms and toff= 0.1ms
therefore<br>
R2 = 4.3kŒ©<br>
R1 = 53.4kŒ©<br>
C=0.01ŒºF<br>
from differentiator ,assuming c= 0.1uF<br>
